# Mathworks UniNA:AI
 During the event different AI applications were showed using mathworks products. In particular:

* Solving the inverse kinematics problem using the robotic sytem toolbox, once a trajectory in the task space is defined for an UR10 robot
* Camera-based hole identification: find holes in a steel-plate and evaluate the centers coordinates and radii using the computer vision toolbox
* Industrial application of deep learning: Tool wear estimation for drilling of composite materials, defect detection for robotic arc welding and reduced order modeling of additive manufacturing process.
